RESTAURANT APPLICATION WITH JETPACK COMPOSE

Welcome to the restaurant application built using Jetpack Compose, Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection, and following Clean Architecture principles. The app utilizes Retrofit for API implementation and Room for local database storage. Here's an overview of the key points of the project:

KEY POINTS 
1. Dependency Injection with Dagger-Hilt
Dagger-Hilt is used to manage the dependency injection in the app. This powerful library simplifies the process of setting up and organizing dependencies, making it easier to maintain and scale the project.

2. Clean Architecture
The app follows Clean Architecture principles, which promotes a separation of concerns and a modular codebase. This architecture allows for easy testing, scalability, and flexibility as the app evolves.

3. Retrofit for API Implementation
To fetch restaurant data from a remote server, the app uses Retrofit, a popular HTTP client for Android. Retrofit streamlines the process of making API calls and handling the responses in a type-safe manner.

4. Room Database Implementation
For local data storage, Room, an SQLite object mapping library, is integrated into the app. This enables seamless offline access to previously fetched restaurant data, enhancing user experience and reducing network dependencies.

5. Searching Data from Room Database
Users can search for specific restaurants in their local area by leveraging the power of Room database. The app allows for efficient and quick querying of restaurant data, making it easy for users to find the dining options they desire.

GETTING STARTED

To build and run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Install the required dependencies and plugins specified in the project.
3. Build and launch the app on your Android emulator or physical device.

THANK YOU for using our restaurant application with Jetpack Compose, Dagger-Hilt, Clean Architecture, Retrofit, and Room Database implementation. We hope you find it helpful and enjoy exploring the wonderful world of dining options around you!
